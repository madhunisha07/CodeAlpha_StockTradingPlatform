Student Grade Tracker- TASK 1

Project Description
The **Student Grade Tracker** is a Java-based console application developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Internship Program (Task 1)**.  
It allows users to manage student records, calculate grades, and display results using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

 Features
- Add student details (name, marks)
- Calculate total marks and average
- Assign grades based on performance
- Display student results
- Menu-driven console interface
- Implements core OOP principles
- Uses Java collections for dynamic data storage

Technologies Used
- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Scanner (User Input)  
- ArrayList  
- VS Code  
- Git & GitHub
